## Featured Projects

### AI Fighter Matchup  
**Event:** KnightHacks Hackathon  
**Team Size:** 4  
**Stack:** React, FastAPI, Google Gemini API, Python 

#### Inspiration  
Our team has always been fascinated by fighting games and esports. We wanted to connect AI with competitive gaming, so we built a tool that helps players analyze matchups strategically rather than relying on random tier lists.

#### What We Learned  
- Connecting a React frontend with a FastAPI backend  
- Integrating APIs like Google Gemini  
- Structuring a full-stack project and managing teamwork efficiently  
- Using Git and GitHub for version control during a hackathon  

#### Challenges  
The biggest challenge was connecting the backend to the frontend — handling routes, fetch requests, and ensuring smooth data flow. Once we solved these issues, the app came together into a complete, functional product.

### UCF Robotics — VEX U Daydream Team 7  
**Role:** Programmer  
**Team Size:** 6+  
**Stack:** C++, GitHub  

#### What I Did  
- Developed control and autonomous code for two VEX U competition robots using C++  
- Programmed driver control schemes based on driver preferences  
- Built autonomous routines that allowed the robot to perform tasks independently  
- Collaborated with a team of six or more members using GitHub for version control and coordination  

#### Outcome  
This experience strengthened my skills in embedded programming, robotics systems, and collaborative development — combining mechanical precision with programming logic.
